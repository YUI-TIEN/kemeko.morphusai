feat: Enhance VTuber section layout for full-width options and increased height

This commit modifies the "AI Vtuber 的實體舞台" section to allow its options to span the full width of the page on smaller screens and increases the overall height of the section.

Key changes:
- Increased the vertical padding of `.vtuber-section` in `src/styles/global.css` to make the section appear taller.
- Modified `.vtuber-grid` to use a single-column layout by default, ensuring the feature options take up the full width.
- Added a media query to `src/styles/global.css` to revert `.vtuber-grid` to a two-column layout on screens wider than 768px, maintaining responsiveness.
- Adjusted the `margin-top` for `.vtuber-visual` to ensure proper spacing between content and image in both single-column and two-column layouts.
