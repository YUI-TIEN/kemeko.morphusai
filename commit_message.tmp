revert: Temporarily disable advanced features and security for debugging

This commit temporarily disables several advanced features and security configurations to aid in debugging and simplify the deployment process.

Changes include:
- Disabling performance monitoring, debug mode, Content Security Policy (CSP), email obfuscation, and integrity checks in `src/config/animation.ts`.
- Removing all security headers, meta tags, performance hints, and the `initializeKemekoSystem` call from `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`.
- Simplifying the Locomotive Scroll initialization script by removing custom logging and the dynamic import of `simpleInit.ts`.

These changes are intended for troubleshooting and will be re-enabled or refined in future updates.
