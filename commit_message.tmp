feat: Implement interactive image switching for VTuber section

This commit adds interactive functionality to the "AI Vtuber 的實體舞台" section, allowing users to switch the displayed image by clicking on different feature options.

Key changes:
- Added `data-image` attributes to `.vtuber-feature` elements in `src/pages/index.astro` to specify the image path for each option.
- Introduced a new `<img>` tag with `id="vtuber-model-image"` within the `.stage-mockup` to serve as the image display area.
- Implemented JavaScript logic in `src/pages/index.astro` to handle click events on `.vtuber-feature` elements, update the `src` of `vtuber-model-image`, and apply a fade-in/fade-out transition.
- Added CSS in `src/styles/global.css` for `.vtuber-feature` (including `cursor: pointer` and `.active` state styling) and `.vtuber-model-image` (for positioning and transition effects).
