feat: Implement production-ready features and security hardening

This major update transforms the project from a minimal template to a robust, production-grade application.

Key enhancements include:
- Security: Implemented a strict Content Security Policy (CSP), Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external assets, and additional security headers to harden the application.
- Features: Added an email protection utility to prevent scraping and a new system integration module for streamlined initialization.
- Accessibility (A11y): Introduced accessibility features such as `prefers-reduced-motion`, high-contrast mode support, and improved focus visibility.
- Performance: Optimized CSS with hardware acceleration, `contain` property, and added resource hints (`preconnect`, `dns-prefetch`) for faster loading.
- Documentation: Completely overhauled the `README.md` with detailed project information and added new `API.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md` files.
