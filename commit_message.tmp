refactor: Decouple system initialization and improve stability

This commit refactors the system initialization process for better performance and robustness.

Key changes:
- Decoupled the main system initialization from the initial page load by introducing a new `simpleInit.ts` module. This allows for a faster initial render, with non-critical components loading asynchronously.
- Updated the Content Security Policy (CSP) to include `'unsafe-eval'` for compatibility and restricted its application to production environments only.
- Enhanced the stability of the email protection and system integration modules with more robust error handling and logging.
- Removed server-side rendering of the protected email in the footer, making it fully client-side.
