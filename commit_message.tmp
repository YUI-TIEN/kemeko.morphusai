refactor: Adjust layout for VTuber section headings and revert some styling changes

This commit refactors the layout of the VTuber section headings and reverts some previous styling modifications.

Key changes:
- Moved "AI Vtuber 的實體舞台" and "你曾想過，Vtuber 也能走到你面前嗎？" headings to a new `centered-heading` div in `src/pages/index.astro` for better layout control and centering.
- Added CSS for `.centered-heading` in `src/styles/global.css` to ensure proper text alignment.
- Reverted previous changes in `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/styles/global.css` related to the `why-section` and `vtuber-section` to their original state, including:
    - Restoring `floating-elements` in `why-decoration` and removing `rose-petals`.
    - Re-adding `feature-bullet` to `feature-item` in `why-content`.
    - Reverting some animation and performance optimization CSS in `global.css`.
